**Problem 1**
Everybody loves palindromes, but Artur doesn't.
He has a string S that consists of lowercase English letters ('a' - 'z'). Artur wants to find a substring T of S of the maximal length, so that T isn't a palindrome.
Input
The input contains a single line, containing string S. String S consists of lower case English letters.
Output
In a single line print the length of T
Find four elements a, b, c and d in an array such that a+b = c+d
**Problem 2**
Given an array of distinct integers, find if there are two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that a+b = c+d, and a, b, c and d are distinct elements. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.
Example:
Input: {3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8} Output: (3, 8) and (4, 7)
Explanation: 3+8 = 4+7
**Problem 3**
Find number of solutions of a linear equation of n variables
Given a linear equation of n variables, find number of non-negative integer solutions of it. For example,let the given equation be “x + 2y = 5”, solutions of this equation are “x = 1, y = 2”, “x = 5, y = 0” and “x = 1. It may be assumed that all coefficients in given equation are positive integers.
**Problem 4**
Probability of reaching a point with 2 or 3 steps at a time
A person starts walking from position X = 0, find the probability to reach exactly on X = N if she can only take either 2 steps or 3 steps. Probability for step length 2 is given i.e. P, probability for step length 3 is 1 – p.

**Problem 8**
1) Print all combinations of points that can compose a given number.
For eg;
For n = 1, the program should print following:
1
For n = 2, the program should print following:
1 1
2
For n = 3, the program should print following:
1 1 1
1 2
2 1
3
**Problem 9**
2) Check whether a given point lies inside a triangle or not.

**Problem 10**
4) Find day of the week for a given date.
**Problem 11**
5) Print all prime factors of a given number.
For eg;
if the input number is 12, then output should be “2 2 3”.
